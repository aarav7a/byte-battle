 about my topic =EdTech & Habit Building

The EdTech application is a revolutionary tool designed to build sustainable study habits by integrating proven educational techniques with gamified habit-building features. Its core functionality includes Study Streaks to track consistency and motivate users, and Spaced-Repetition Notes that leverage the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve to schedule review sessions at optimal intervals for deep learning and retention. The platform also fosters Peer Learning & Collaboration through dedicated study spaces, and aids organization with Exam Prep Boards that break down large syllabi into manageable, trackable tasks. Finally, a Quiz Engine offers robust assessment and promotes active recall using various formats that pull directly from user notes and a central question bank.
